<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="B-F-Skinner"><a href="#B-F-Skinner" class="headerlink" title="B.F. Skinner"></a>B.F. Skinner</h2><p>He is known in the field of psychology for his famous animal experiments in which he demonstrated the power of rewards and reinforcements to shape behavior. Using food, levers, and other environmental cues, Skinner demonstrated that what appears to be autonomous responses are really cued, and in doing so he threw into question the long-cherished notion of free will.</p>
<h3 id="Experiments"><a href="#Experiments" class="headerlink" title="Experiments"></a>Experiments</h3><p>When Skinner was studying at Harvard University, he had made a lot of ‘boxes’, just boxes. And one day he looked at the squirrels and wonder if he can condition them to perform a certain action.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/skinner%20box.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then Skinner started with rats. After he put them into his box for some time, he observed that they had quickly learned how to press a lever if they were rewarded with food.</p>
<p>The difference between his experiment and Pavlov’s is that while Pavlov focused on an animal’s behavior in response to a prior stimulus, which is the <strong>bell</strong>, Skinner focused on an animal’s behavior in response to an after-the-fact consequence, the <strong>food</strong>.</p>
<p>Skinner went further than this, he played with the rate of food giving and found that universal laws of behaviorism still hold true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behaviorism is a theory of learning based upon the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning. Behaviorism focuses on objectively observable behaviors and discounts any independent activities of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if he changed the rate of level pressing to three times one food, the rats will consistently press for three times after, they will not follow the original traits of one press one food.</p>
<p>When he switched to an intermittently reward system, which means rewards are given negatively random, maybe the 10th or the 33rd. He found that this kind of system leads to hopelessness and the extinction of behavior, which means the rats will stop pressing levers for food.</p>
<p>This lead to the conclusion of the experiments, rats(also humans) is more attracted by rewards than punishments.</p>
<h3 id="Implications"><a href="#Implications" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Upon seeing the success of conditioning the rats, he born the ideas of teaching pigeons to play ping pong, and so on, he thinks that human is the same. We are doing things as we are conditioned, we don’t have free will. It makes some sense to me, one common example is that, when some people see their phone, they can’t help pick up it and play with it even they don’t have anything to do. The phone is controlling us, we thought it is our idea to play, but actually, the phone is yielding you.</p>
<p>Skinner raised his second daughter in a box, which provided Deborah with a place to sleep and remain comfortably warm throughout the severe Minnesota winters without having to be wrapped in numerous layers of clothing and blankets (and developing the attendant rashes). Deborah slept in her novel crib until she was two and a half years old, and by all accounts grew up a happy, healthy, thriving child.</p>
<p>The book started with the author’s search for Skinner’s daughter, <strong>Deborah Skinner</strong>, who according to the myths shot herself because of Skinner’s box education for her. It was proved by her sister, Julie Vargas, that Deborah was alive and led a pretty happy life. </p>
<h2 id="Obscura-–-Stanley-Milgram-and-Obedience-to-authority"><a href="#Obscura-–-Stanley-Milgram-and-Obedience-to-authority" class="headerlink" title="Obscura – Stanley Milgram and Obedience to authority"></a>Obscura – Stanley Milgram and Obedience to authority</h2><p>The starting point of Milgram’s experiment is the Holocaust, he wonders how these Nazi soldiers are willing to take the orders to kill so many innocent people. And this makes sense because I don’t think everyone under Hitler’s commands shares the same thoughts against the Jews. The general explanation is called “the authoritarian personality”, which refers to special childhood shape the person’s mind of doing anything if instructed. But Milgram wasn’t satisfied with this explanation, it’s too narrow.</p>
<h3 id="Experiment"><a href="#Experiment" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p>With his suspicions, he reconstructs a scene that looks similar to the Holocaust in some ways. He had a fake shocking machine and recruited hundreds of volunteers. He ordered these volunteers to deliver what they believed were lethal levels of electricity to an actor who feigned pain and even death. In this scene, volunteers are like Nazi soldiers, they are taking orders from a doctor, which is the same as the officer in the battleground.</p>
<p>During the experiment, the volunteer and the actor are in separate rooms, and the doctor instructed the volunteer to read words to the actor, who will repeat after him if the actor makes a mistake, then give him a shock, starting from 15 volts and each time add 15 volts. The experiment shows that 65% of the volunteers actually follow the doctor’s order which will actually kill normal people.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Milgram_experiment_v2.svg/1200px-Milgram_experiment_v2.svg.png" alt=""><br>The researchers divided them into two categories, one is obedient and the other is defiant. Milgram, who believed this obedience wasn’t caused by personality, began investigating all these volunteer’s lives, hoping to find something.</p>
<p>But the real problem is that people are wondering what is the implications of Milgram’s experiment. Does it mean that people will be likely to condemn when in a situation where he knows nothing while the other one is an experiment? So is it the situation that makes 65% of people follow the killing order? In that case, does it mean that this only happens when people are in pressure and involving killing? This leads to the conclusion that the results of the experiment can not be replicated outside the world, so what’s the meaning of this experiment, it shows something that we would 90% not encounter.</p>
<p>Besides, the book also listed the ethical question that experiment carries, letting innocent people ‘killing’ people with their very own hand, it may let them question their nature and more. But actually, the influence wasn’t that big as presented in the book the two volunteer authors meet. One Obedient and a defiant, one called Jacob and one called Joshua. Jacob, the obedient, said that the experiment let him reevaluate himself and find what he really lacks and thus becoming a better person. Joshua was defiant who stopped the shock when its 150 volts, he was pretty proud of stopping it. After, he argued with Milgram with the ethical question but only receive Milgram’s request of not saying the true meaning of the experiment. What’s curious is that the defiant is obedient this time, he kept the secret.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-1"><a href="#Implications-1" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being. Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up.</p>
<p>People tend to obey orders from other people if they recognize their authority as morally right and/or legally based. This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations, for example in the family, school, and workplace.</p>
<h2 id="On-Being-Sane-in-Insane-Places-–-Experimenting-with-psychiatric-Diagnosis"><a href="#On-Being-Sane-in-Insane-Places-–-Experimenting-with-psychiatric-Diagnosis" class="headerlink" title="On Being Sane in Insane Places – Experimenting with psychiatric Diagnosis"></a>On Being Sane in Insane Places – Experimenting with psychiatric Diagnosis</h2><p>In the early 1970s, David Rosenhan decided to test how well psychiatrists were able to distinguish the “sane” from the “insane.” Basically, psychiatrists have a huge social control since they are the only group of people who can provide a “reliably” diagnosis of aberrant mental conditions. Sometimes is hard to distinguish a normal from an abnormal, because their actions may appear the same. </p>
<p>Rosenhan was conscious and critical of it that he devised an experiment to test whether their actual skills were on par with their power. He recruited eight other people, and together they faked their way into various mental institutions, and then once in the ward, they acted completely normally. </p>
<p>The goal was to see whether the psychiatrists would detect their sanity, or whether the psychiatrists’ judgments would be clouded by presuppositions.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-s3.onedio.com/id-578d7b24d166f32b137ecc00/rev-0/w-635/listing/f-jpg-webp/s-86971458c25331fb462c35d09716ba8f7371e42a.webp" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Experiment-1"><a href="#Experiment-1" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p> Rosehan heard one of his colleges who went to Vietnam saying that lots of men used mental illness as a way of avoiding the draft in law. This sparked his curiosity.</p>
<p>Then, he recruited eight friends and ask them if they are busy next month. All eight were not busy and agree to Rosenhan’s request to pretend to be insane. The pseudopatients were to present themselves and claim that “I’m hearing a voice, it is saying thud.” It was specifically selected by Rosenhan because nowhere in the psychiatric literature are there any reports of any personn hearing a voice that contains such obvious cartoon angst. This is the only symptoms they are having, no other to be feigned. Once on the ward, if admitted, they were to immediately say that the voice had disappeared and they now felt fine. They also learned a lesson from Rosenhan about how to manage the medication, to avoid swallowing it by slipping it under the tongue.</p>
<p>All of them were admitted, what they have observed in the institution is that “mental patients are unworthy of account”,  people working there don’t treat them as normal human. After all the signs of normal beign showed, the doctor still didn’t want them to leave, claiming them still illed. The stange thing is that while dotcor weren’t capable of distinguishing, other real patients are conscious that they are normal, they even say that “you are a journalist”.</p>
<p>This trip showed Rosenhan the inhumanity in the asylum and realized that there must have been normal people being diagnosed as mental illness. All his pseudopatients’ staying are between 7 and 52 days, and each od them have been labeled different dieases.</p>
<p>He was critized by lots of experts in the field, who claimed that this testimony and conclusion is not fair for them. Some of them then revised a more concrete standard of identifying mental illness, but who knows if it will be effective. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Patients must display at least four of the symptoms from criteria A for at least two weeks, three of the followinng symptoms from criteria B and one from criteria C.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spitzer, an expert in Psychiatry, saied that,”all diagnoses are manmade classifactios, so that criticism is ridiculous. With the new diagnostic system in place, Rosenhan’s experiment could never happen today.” </p>
<h3 id="Implications-2"><a href="#Implications-2" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>The validity of Psychiatry still remainned to be questioned, and even the doctors would be alluded to deal with the patients. </p>
<h1 id="In-the-Unlikely-Event-of-a-Water-Landing-Darley-and-Latane’s-Traininng-Manual-Five-stage-approach"><a href="#In-the-Unlikely-Event-of-a-Water-Landing-Darley-and-Latane’s-Traininng-Manual-Five-stage-approach" class="headerlink" title="In the Unlikely Event of a Water Landing - Darley and Latane’s Traininng Manual - Five stage approach."></a>In the Unlikely Event of a Water Landing - Darley and Latane’s Traininng Manual - Five stage approach.</h1><p>In 1964 there occurred a bizarre crime in New York City that catalyzed two young psychologists to investigate witness behavior.</p>
<p>It was March 13th, Friday the thriteenth actually, in the year 1964. Catherinne Genovese, in 3 A.M, found there’s a suspicious man following her after she pulled her car into the space. She never made it to the call box to tell the police, and she was stabbed by this man with a knife deep into her back. She <strong>Scream</strong> and <strong>Scream</strong>, loud enough for someone to notice. However, instead of coming down to stop the crime, only one shout “let that girl alone.” </p>
<p>No one has come down to stopped this terrible crime, the criminal decided to continue, but he never finished his dirty actions. The crime occurred over a thirty-five-minute period, between 3:15 and 3:50 AM. It occurred in a series of three separate attacks, all of them drawn out and punctured with screams for help. People, all the witnesses, those who flicked on their lights, could both hear and see. They did nothing.</p>
<h2 id="Experiment-2"><a href="#Experiment-2" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h2><p>People attributed the cause of this to public apathy, saying that it is the mainfestation of aggressiveness. However, Darley and Latané were not happy with the explanation, in part because, like Milgram, they were experimental social psychologists who believed less in the power of personality than in the power of situation, and in part because the explanations defied intuitive sense.</p>
<p>So they set about constructing ann experiment. For obvious reasons they could not replicate a mureder, so instead they replicated a seizure.</p>
<p>They used recruitted navie subjects at New York University to participate in what appeared to be a study of studennt adaptation to urban college life. They were made to talk to someone through a wall about their difficulties in NYU study, and then they will hear a pre-recorded tape playing the sound of a man seizuring, “I-er-um-I Think I-I nneed-er-if-if could-er-er somebody ……..”</p>
<p>The experiment was designed very well that it replicate almost all the traits of Genovese murder, that the witness was able to hear but unable to talk to them, when the seizure happened, the subjects knows that someone else will hear it as well, and the seizure itself lasted for about six minutes which is also a series of actions.</p>
<p>The result shows that only 31% of the subjects acted. Darley and Latane varied the size of the “groups”. When a subjects believed he or she was in a group of four or more, the subject was unlikely yo seek help for the victim. The longer the witness wait, the more unlikely he is going to help. After some simliar data comparsion betweenn Genovese and the seizure, Darley and latane surmise that, far from feeling apathy, subjects had not decided not to respond. Rather, they were still in a state of indecision and conflict conncerning whether to repond or not.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-3"><a href="#Implications-3" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Because response rates were so consistenntly tied to group size, Darley and Latane understood what nont one else yet had: a phenomenon they came to call “diffusionn of responsibility”. The more people witnessing an event, the less responsible any one individual feels, because responsibility is evenly distributed anong the crowd.</p>
<p>Another experiment also showed how social cuing works, the bystander effect. We will follow what others think because in that way, we don’t have to think ourselves. Everyday we are exposed in a world where contains all kind of complex signals, if we take care of each one of them carefully, we will be overwhelmed. So it’s our nature to just follow what others’ do and think.</p>
<h2 id="Quieting-the-Mind"><a href="#Quieting-the-Mind" class="headerlink" title="Quieting the Mind"></a>Quieting the Mind</h2><p>Leon Festinger was born May 8, 1919, to parents of Russian descent. In 1957, he published his best known work, A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, in which he writes,” the psychological oppositionn of irreconciable ideas held simultaneously by one individual, created a motivating force that would lead, under proper conditions, to the adjustment of one’s belief to fit one’s behavior – instead of changinng one’s behavior to fit one’s belief.</p>
<h3 id="Experiment-3"><a href="#Experiment-3" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p>There was a cult, consists of those one believd that there will be an impending flood on midnight, December 21, 1954, and they believed in a god named <strong>Sanada</strong> woule come and save them. Festinnger organized a few cohorts to go under cover, posing as believers annd gaining entry into the cult. They observed the member’ intense preparation for the solstice event.</p>
<p>People in the cult have ditched their life, waiting to be saved by <strong>Sanada</strong>, there are people quitting a doctor job, people sold his house. Expectedly and unexpectedly, the savior did not appear that night, and some cult members, visibly shocked, wept innto their hands, others just lay on couches, staring blankly into the empty sky.</p>
<p>Festinger has notived a stange thing, that the cult members instead of vanishing, they invited all the media into their places and claimed that the reason why the big flood is not coming is because the little group sitting all night long had spread so much ligth that god saved the world from destruction.</p>
<p>What Festinger found, in his infiltration of the cult annd in his readings of the history, was that it is precisely when a belief is disconfirmed that religious groups begin to proselytize, a sort of desperate defense mechanism. This disjunction between what one believes and the factual evidence is highly uncomfortable. He has also done some experiements to test this theory in all dimensions. He giving two groups of volunteers 1 dollar and 20 dollars, asking them to spread a lie. The results shows that people who receive 1 dollar are more likely to believe the lie themselves, because people who got 20 dollars thinks that they are doing this for the money, but for 1 dollar, it’s nothing, they had to find a reason for their action to make sense.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-4"><a href="#Implications-4" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Festinger’s discovery oppose Skinner’s believe that people have no free will, instead we are always thinking, as Festinger said,”Human beings think. They engage in the most amazing mental gymnastics, all just to justify their hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>The seekinng of consonance is a drive state. We spend our lives payinng attentionn only to informationn that is consonant with our beliefs, we surround ourselves with people who will support our beliefs, and we ignore contradictory information that might cause us to question what we have built.</p>
<p>As presented in the book, the author mentioned a religious group she met, the leader’s daughter can heal people from sufferings, whereas the leader herself has breast cancer and did not ask her daughter for healing. She claimed that sufferings has on meaning. Different from changing the belief, she found an explanation. In my opinion, it’s the same, both ways is directing to making sense to their actions and beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="Monkey-love-Harry-Harlow’s-primates"><a href="#Monkey-love-Harry-Harlow’s-primates" class="headerlink" title="Monkey love - Harry Harlow’s primates"></a>Monkey love - Harry Harlow’s primates</h2><p>Harry Harlow’s experiments with wire monnkeys are central demonstrations in the psychology of attachment. Harlow was able to show that infant monkeys cared more for a soft surrogate mother than a mental milk-baering one, and with this finding, a whole science of touch was born.</p>
<p>During Harlow’s study on Monkey’s head, he would separate the Monkey infants from their mother and he observed that infants, when separated, became extremely attached to the terry cloth towerls coering the cage floors. They woule lie on them, grip them in their tiny fists, tantrum if they were taken away.</p>
<p>This was a huge question and it was explainned with a theory called drive reduction. This theory says that we love our mothers because we love their milk. A baby clinngs to its mother because it sees the swollen breasts, the tan aureole and the nunb nipple risinng from its pleated folds, and it feels thirst or hunger. Human attachment is predicated on this theory, hunger is a primary drive and we want to reduce it.</p>
<h3 id="Experiment-4"><a href="#Experiment-4" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p>Harlow questions the relationship between love and this theory.</p>
<p>The experiment required wire cutters, cardboard cones, hot coils,steel nails and soft cloth. Harlow used the wire cutters to fashion a wire mother, its torso patterned with small squares everywhere, a single inflexible breast “on the ventral front.” Affixed to this breast, a steel nipple pierced with a tiny hole through which the monkey milk can flow. Then Harlow fashioned a soft surrogate, a cardboard cone bunted in a terry cloth towel.</p>
<p>With the experiment started, a group of newborn rhesus macaque babies went into the cage with a cloth surrogate mother. Within a matter of days, the baby macaques transferred their affections from the real mother to ,who were no longer available, to the cloth surrogate mother, to whom they clung, over whom they crawled, mannipulating her face in their miniature hands.</p>
<p>But the cloth mother doesn’t have milk, when the babies are hungry , they would go to the steel mammary machine to get milk. Here Harlow was establishing that love grows from touch, not taste, which is why, when the mother’s milk dries up, as it inevitably does, the child continues to love her.</p>
<p>Then, Harlow hypothesized, the face is another love variable. The plan was to take yet another newborn macaque and give it a surrogate with some beauty and see what sort of attachment follows. However the monkey was born before the finish of the face, as Harlow dropped the newborns with the terry cloth mom, who had only a blank featureless flatland for a face. </p>
<p>It did not seem to matter. The little monkey still loved the faceless mother, kissing it, nibbling it. The researcher tried to attach a monkey mask, which is so much prettier, so much more interesting, to the cloth mother. But it was done, the little monkey was horrified that they rushed to the corner, screaming. Only when the small monkey knocked off the mask, can they come forward and play.</p>
<p>There’s also darker side of Harlow’s experiment, after all, he hates them. He built an Iron madien which is similar to the surrogate mother but it can torture the baby monkey. With the Iron madien, Harlow discovered that whatever the toture, the baby would still love the madien.</p>
<p>Continued the experiment, Harlow onticed the cloth-mothered monnkeys were not thriving – this, after he made such a bold pronouncement in front of all his peers. When he took the cloth-mothered monkeys out to play and mate, they were biolently antisocial. Then Harlow noticed that he had made a mistake. According to one of Harlow’s student, they have hypothesized it had something to do with motion too. They made a surrogate that could rock and the babies were almost normal then.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-5"><a href="#Implications-5" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Annimal rights. In this series of experiments, the monkeys were shaped as creature that don’t know love, some of them kill their infants, some of them are antisocial, some of the  infants were beaten by the their loving ‘mother’. The book used over 10 pages discussning the ethical question about Harlow, it gives opinions that animals’ life is equal to humans’. However when it comes to personal, everyone would choose human over animals. I think it’s not a question about ethical, it’s a question about perspective, we human and animals are all living in the nature, we are equal. Having intelligence doesn’t mean that it gives us the perspective as a judger of the nature. We are in the same level as animals, it’s not our decision that whether it’s right to use monkeys as experiment unit.</p>
<p>Love is consists of motion,play and touch.</p>
<h2 id="Rat-Park-The-Radical-Addiction-Experiment"><a href="#Rat-Park-The-Radical-Addiction-Experiment" class="headerlink" title="Rat Park - The Radical Addiction Experiment"></a>Rat Park - The Radical Addiction Experiment</h2><p>Bruce Alexander and coinvestigators Robert Coambs and Oatricia Hadaway, in 1981, decided to challennge the central premise of addiction as illustrated by classic animal experiments. Their hypothesis: strapping a monnkey into a seat for days on end, and giving it a buttonn to push for relief, says nonthing about the power of drugs and everythingn about the power of restraints – social, physcial and psychological. Their idea was to test the ainmals in a truly benevolent environment, and to see whether addiction was still the inevitable result.</p>
<p>Bruce Alexander, PHD, a psychologist who live in Vanncouver thinks that the addiction to drugs was ont caused by the pharmacology but the complex weave of unsupportive societies. He has two stark claims: there is really nnothing “inherently addictive” about any drugs, and repeated exposures to even the most enticinng drugs do not usually lead to problems.</p>
<p>History can prove his point of view, a study showed that the vast majority of hospitalized patients exposed to consistently high doses of morphine were able to come off without a problem once their pain had resolved, and the Ontario household survey, which showed that nninety-five percent of Ontarians who use cocaine do so less than once per month.</p>
<p>However, as other psychologiest proved, a white lab rat will monomaniacally press a lever to receive eletrical brain simulation in what was thought to be the reward center. There has also other experiments where psychologists hook animals up to self-injecting  catheters and let them get high as kites while they slowly starved to death. This was an evidence that addiction is realted to pharmacology power. But Alexander wonder, if the pleasure center is so easily simulated, why would only a small portion of drug users gets addicted.</p>
<p>He wants proof so he started an experiment, which has two groups of rats, one was isolated caged and the other one is a rat colony with all the advantage possible. He found that the cramped and isolated caged rats loved the morphine-laced water right from its subtle, sugary start. The rat park residents resisted drinking the narcotic solution, no matter how sweet the researchers made it, and they showed preferrence for striaght H2O.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-6"><a href="#Implications-6" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Alexander then explored the broader implications of Rat Park experiments for human beings. The main conclusions of his experimental and historical research since 1985 can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drug addiction is only a small corner of the addiction problem. Most serious addictions do not involve either drugs or alcohol</li>
<li>Addiction is more a social problem than an individual problem. When socially integrated societies are fragmented by internal or external forces, addiction of all sorts increases dramatically, becoming almost universal in extremely fragmented societies.</li>
<li>Addiction arises in fragmented societies because people use it as a way of adapting to extreme social dislocation. As a form of adaptation, addiction is neither a disease that can be cured nor a moral error that can be corrected by punishment and education.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Lost-in-the-Mall-The-False-Memory-Experiment"><a href="#Lost-in-the-Mall-The-False-Memory-Experiment" class="headerlink" title="Lost in the Mall - The False Memory Experiment"></a>Lost in the Mall - The False Memory Experiment</h2><p>Our notions of memory are largely based on these two men’s ideas: Freud and Plato, by no means bad company to keep. Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus, however, decided to challenge the field’s great fathers. Her hunch? Memory is as slippery as a stream, as unreliable as a rat.</p>
<p>In 1990 , a lawyer, Dou g Horngrad, called her to testify in a particularly troubling case. Horngrad’s client was a sixty-three-year-old man, George Franklin, whos e beautiful red-headed daughter Eileen claimed she remembered, twenty or so years after the fact, that her father raped and murdered her best friend. Loftus doesn’t believe the girl’s word because she thinks it’s inpossible to totally forgot the thing when witnessing, but recalling every detail in whole decade after the traumatic.</p>
<h3 id="Experiment-5"><a href="#Experiment-5" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p>But she needs proof, a proof that shows memory is not reliable, and false memories can be planted. THE EXPERIMENT HAD many phases. In some pretest versions, Lofts had university students attempt to implant false memories in their siblings over Thanksgiving vacation, tape the sessions, and then present them to her after the holiday. These, although part of the pilot, proved to be some of the richest demonstrations of fact buckling under fiction’s weight.</p>
<p>Loftus prepared for each subject a small bookle t containing three written accounts of real childhood memorie s provided by a subject’s family member, and on e false written account of being lost in the maD. Th e constructed stories, done with family members wh o agreed to help in the hoax, were each on e paragraph long. Subjects came to the lab, read the memor y booklets, and were instructed to elaborate on them with their own recollections, and if they had none , to simply write , “ I don’t remembe r this.”</p>
<p>What surprised Loftus most about the results of her experiment were not the statistically significant figures, but the narrative detail that accompanied some of the false memories. They seemed to have lived this memory, that they remember how they feel at being lost and people they met that day.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-7"><a href="#Implications-7" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>In settings where either a therapist or a law-enforcement officer is trying to access ‘forgotten’ or so-called ‘repressed’ memories from a patient or witness, the science of false memory has indeed shown that there are considerable dangers in using suggestive techniques and misinformation (even unwittingly).</p>
<h2 id="Memory-Inc-ERIC-KANDEL’-S-SEA-SLUG-EXPERIMENT"><a href="#Memory-Inc-ERIC-KANDEL’-S-SEA-SLUG-EXPERIMENT" class="headerlink" title="Memory Inc - ERIC KANDEL’ S SEA SLUG EXPERIMENT"></a>Memory Inc - ERIC KANDEL’ S SEA SLUG EXPERIMENT</h2><p>Kandel set out on a journey to discover the actual workings of memory, its intricate cellular mechanisms, and he challenged Loftus’s claim that there were no neural mechanisms for repression.</p>
<p>The story begins with a patient called Henry who always suffered from seizure, and there’s a dotcor called Scoville who had been working on people’s brain for a long time. He decided to remove Henry’s hippocampus, and this was an experiment, because not much is clear about the bio of the brain, no one know what will happen to Henry.</p>
<p>In the days following the surgery, it became clear that Henry was having far fewer fits. It also became clear that he had lost the ability to form any memories. A nurse introduced herself, left, and five minutes later, Henry had not the faintest idea who she was. That’s when Scoville realized that he has accidentally discover the bio parts responsible for memory.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Brenda Milner, who discovered that memory has two parts and hippocampus is one of it. By studying Henry, who clearly lost his memory function, she found that Henr still remember how to brush his teeth when a toothbrush was placed in his mouth, he still remember how to walk.</p>
<p>So she thinks there is another memory system located in a whole other place in the brain, and this Milner called procedural memory, or unconscious memory. Even if, and when, we lose our ability to recall names and faces, we may still know how to ride a bike, or smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p>Here comes Eric Kandel, who thinks the secrets of memory lie in the study of how nerve cells talk to their neighbors. He wanted to show the connection between psychoanalysis and biology(neuroscience). Kandel did an extensive search for a suitable experimental animal, and settled on slugs, specifically the giant marine snail aplysia. Aplysia has only twenty thousand neurons, many of them visible to the eye.</p>
<h3 id="Experiment-6"><a href="#Experiment-6" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h3><p>He trained his sea slugs. He touched their goopy bodies—their siphons—with an electric probe, and the sea slug’s gill withdrew. Kandel, along with several of his colleagues, soon discovered that this simple reflex could be modified by three different forms of learning: habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning. Kandel observed what actually happened to the sea slug’s neurons as they remembered a new skill. </p>
<p>He discovered that the links between the neurons, called synapses, grew stronger by passing electrochemical signals that reinforced the relationship. He watched two neurons, one sensory, the other motor, pass stronger impulses to each other as behavior became engraved. It means that whenever we are practicing a task, the electrochemical conversation between neurons become smoother and stronger.</p>
<p>Conntinue Kandel’s research, he now wonder how did short term memories grow into long term memories. Kandel cored aplysia and put just two of its preserved neurons in broth as he believed there’s a mechanism existed to transform short term memory to long term memory. Kandel then showed that by blocking a tiny molecul e deep in nerve cell 1, a molecule called cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) , he could disrupt the conversation. With CREB blocked, the events associated with long-term memory formation—protein synthesis, the growth of new synapses—did not occur.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-8"><a href="#Implications-8" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>Kandel showed that memory is related to nerual part, our memory was product of some protein and nerual contacts. Memory has two parts, short term and long term, for short term to transform into long form, a protein called CREB needs to form. But also, it says the power of forgetting, our brain is limited, if we remember all the things, it will be overwhelmed some day.</p>
<h2 id="Chipped-THIS-CENTURY’-S-MOST-RADICAL-MIND-CURES"><a href="#Chipped-THIS-CENTURY’-S-MOST-RADICAL-MIND-CURES" class="headerlink" title="Chipped - THIS CENTURY’ S MOST RADICAL MIND CURES"></a>Chipped - THIS CENTURY’ S MOST RADICAL MIND CURES</h2><p>lobotomy, or its offshoot, cingulotomy, is performed with as much guesswork as actual knowledge, is rooted far more in opinion than fact, and is always an unpredictable journey into the grayest matter. It was hard to explore the brain, because it involved  experimenting ng with real people, and any mistakes will kill or disable the patient.</p>
<p>Antonio Egas Moniz, the winner of the Nobel Prize in 1949 for his discovery of psychosurgery, is the main character of this experiment. He wonder what’s the brain look like , and then he developed a dye that could be injected straight into the neck’s blood vessels, spreading upward to illuminate, with the aid of an x-ray machine, the previously hidden branches of vessels and lobes. With this invention, Moniz made it possible to locate tumors and fault lines.</p>
<p>It’s just dangerous and may cost the patients their lives, no one would like to be injected bromide. Then his practice cause a death, which he claims that he was tormented by it. He later came up with the idea to relieve anxiety states in man by surgical means when he heard that there’s patient with bad temper and anxiety.</p>
<p>After a short period of observation, the female patients proved to be normal. Then Moniz went on finding more patients. So he went ahead, plucking patients wherever he could, drilling them, filling the bulbs of their heads with cold clear alcohol, and then checking their vital signs as the ether burned through intelligent tissue. Afterward, several scarred and barren places on the brain, like land looks as it is seen from an airplane following a forest fire.</p>
<p>Altogether then, supposedly seventy percent of the patients had some significant remission of longstanding intractable mental illness with no reported long-term problematic side effects.</p>
<h3 id="Implications-9"><a href="#Implications-9" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h3><p>It’s hard to define if it’s really a experiment, Moniz explore our way out of pharmacology, with some many “experiment” on patients, with 70% of them cured. It turns out that lobotomy can cure the anxiety through operation, but in that way, our humanity are weaken, since the complete was destroyed. In some people’s life, suffering is a great part , which can remind themselves who they are, or in some cases is their orgin of ideas and passion. We believe suffering bring us humanity, but with lobotomy removing all the suffering, we will notice something is missing. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h1 id="Reinforcement-learning-–-Thomas-Sampling"><a href="#Reinforcement-learning-–-Thomas-Sampling" class="headerlink" title="Reinforcement learning – Thomas Sampling"></a>Reinforcement learning – <strong>Thomas Sampling</strong></h1><p>This is the continue of the previous article, which talks about UCB algorithm and Multi-Armed Bandit. My suggestion is to read that before you read this one, which gives you a clearer understanding.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Recap"><a href="#Recap" class="headerlink" title="Recap"></a>Recap</h2><p>UCB and Thomas Sampling are two effective algorithms used to solve a gambling problem. A gambler walked into a casino with the desire to be <strong>Rich</strong> by playing bandit machine, but the casino has five identical bandit machines. He wants to know whcih one has the highest probability of winning money. Trying without stragedy is only wasting money, so he has to decide a stragedy which can help him determine the best machine in a short time.<br><img src="https://www.topbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cover_multi_armed_bandit_1600px_web-1280x640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Thomas-Sampling"><a href="#Thomas-Sampling" class="headerlink" title="Thomas Sampling"></a>Thomas Sampling</h2><p>Thomas Sampling is a easy and effective way of solving this question, since it can be realized in one line of code. </p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="keyword">as</span> np </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pymc </span><br><span class="line">choice = np.argmax(pymc.rbeta(<span class="number">1</span> + wins, <span class="number">1</span> + trials - wins)) </span><br><span class="line">wins[choice] += <span class="number">1</span> </span><br><span class="line">trials += <span class="number">1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now, let’s talk about the mechanics behind Thomas Sampling (it’s a intuition for the algorithm, not for the math concepts behind it.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Thomas Sampling suppose that each bandit has its own distribution of probability of winning money, some of the center may be higher than the other. we call the true mean <strong>p</strong>.</li>
<li>By constantly trying, you can secure a range, a interval which you can have confidence in saying that the true mean lies in between.(The confidence interval talked about in UCB)</li>
<li>Then how can we decide the distribution of the probability. We need to introduce beat distribution here, which takes in two parameter, wins and loses. <strong>Beta(wins, lose)</strong></li>
<li>Each machine has its own Beta parameter, in each round of trying, select one machine and tey it, then record the result, if gain money, then add 1 to the wins, or add 1 to the loses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Explanition"><a href="#Explanition" class="headerlink" title="Explanition"></a>Explanition</h2><p>I think you should be confused, don’t worry, I will use some graphs for you to better understand.<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggpzvk3fl1j31wq0u0qr6.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggpzvk3fl1j31wq0u0qr6.jpg"><br>In this graph, we have three distribution based on 4 rounds of trails, the middle straight line are the true winning probability in each machine, which the algorithm doesn’t know. Here, each color part represent the beta distribution created by the 4 rounds of data. Then the Machine will randomly select a value from each distribution.<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq01b2hw1j32050u01c9.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq01b2hw1j32050u01c9.jpg"><br>we can imagine this selection process as a simulation ran by the computer, in this simulation the algorithm will choose the highest because it seems like its the best one to play. In this case, the algorithm will choose the green one. </p>
<p>After choosing the highest one, the algorithm will go to the dataset and then read the actual value of that machine in that round.<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq12km8wyj320i0u04hx.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq12km8wyj320i0u04hx.jpg"><br>This green point is the actual value of that machine in that round, and then the Green distribution will be changed since one more value are added to the Beta(win,lose). </p>
<p>This is what Thomas sampling are doing in each round, after many rounds, the distribution can be shortened narrow enough to deternmine which one has the highest probability. (like this)<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq16bgxtgj32280u0tqn.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq16bgxtgj32280u0tqn.jpg"> </p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h2><p>Now, let’s translate what we have learned into code, which I believe can give you a more clear understanding of Thomas Sampling.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are a employee at a advertisement company and your boss wants you to decide which advertisment are the best one to advocating for your product among 10 different types.</p>
<p>You need to know which advertisement can be most attractive, and the way you determine it’s degree of attractiveness is through the number of clicks.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">## prepartion</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="keyword">as</span> np</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="keyword">as</span> pd</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> random</span><br><span class="line">df = pd.read_csv(<span class="string">'Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv'</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>First, Import necessary libraries and the practice dataset we are using.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">N = <span class="number">600</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## how many rounds the algorithm are doing</span></span><br><span class="line">d = <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## how many kinds of advertisements</span></span><br><span class="line">ads_selected = []</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## keep track of the selection of advertisement in each round </span></span><br><span class="line">number_of_reward1 = [<span class="number">0</span>]*d</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## keep track of the winning(clicked) number of each advertisement</span></span><br><span class="line">number_of_reward0 = [<span class="number">0</span>]*d</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## keep tack of the losing(not clicked) nunmber of each advertisement</span></span><br><span class="line">total_rewards = <span class="number">0</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Second, this is basically the same set up as in UCB, the only difference is that in Thomas Sampling we have to keep track of the number of winning times and losing times in order to build the Beta distribution.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> n <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>,N):</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="comment">## initialize </span></span><br><span class="line">    ad = <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">    max_random = <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## start rounds</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>,d):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## use a function in random class to create a beta distribution and select a value, inputs are win and lose(the plus here mean to make two parameter greater than 0, since the Betavariate function did not take 0 as parameter.)</span></span><br><span class="line">        random_beta = random.betavariate((number_of_reward1[i]+<span class="number">1</span>),(number_of_reward0[i]+<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">## selecting the biggest value in this round</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (random_beta &gt; max_random):</span><br><span class="line">            max_random = random_beta</span><br><span class="line">            ad = i</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## record the selection</span></span><br><span class="line">    ads_selected.append(ad)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## get the actual value of that machine in the dataset</span></span><br><span class="line">    reward = df.values[n,ad]</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## change the parameter of winning or losing, necessary to change the distributionn</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> reward == <span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        number_of_reward1[ad] += <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        number_of_reward0[ad] += <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">        </span><br><span class="line">    total_rewards += reward</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Third, sarting looping through each rounds and each advertisement, the <code>ads_selected</code> list will record all the selection, and the one with highest selection number is the most attractive advertisement among 10.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize the results.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">plt.hist(ads_selected)</span><br><span class="line">plt.title(<span class="string">'Histogram of ads selections'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.xlabel(<span class="string">'Ads'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.ylabel(<span class="string">'Number of times each ad was selected'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.show()</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq1t028uij30na0fc3zt.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggq1t028uij30na0fc3zt.jpg"><br>It’s obvious that advertisement 4 has the highest click number.</p>
<h2 id="Concluding"><a href="#Concluding" class="headerlink" title="Concluding"></a>Concluding</h2><p>Thomas sampling and UCB are the two well known algorithms in Reinforcement learning, both are effective, and both are different. We can see that in UCB, the algorithm need 5000 trails to get the result, while Thomas Sampling only requires 600 trails to see the comparison. But there’s indeed no better one between these two, it depends on the situations.</p>
<p>I hope you get some insights from this article abour Thomas Sampling, please forgive me if there’s anything wrong or misleading. Thanks for Reading!!!!</p>

    <url>/2020/07/10/Reading/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h1 id="Experience"><a href="#Experience" class="headerlink" title="Experience"></a>Experience</h1><p>Reading was never my thing untill I came to America. Back in China, I have only read textbooks, never completed a single book outside classroom. I don’t like it because I consider it very inefficient compared to videos which is attracting and visually understandable text are hard to understand and I don’t have the patience to read along 300 pages.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>After I came to America, I struggle in reading, not only because I have never read, but also because it’s in English. I usually need to spend 3 minutes, back and forth between translations and boom,to finish a page without full understanding. But I can only read it since it’s class’s requirement.</p>
<p>What changes my attitude towards reading is, maybe surprsing to you, SAT.  As we all know, SAT has a  difficult reading part, which is even more complicated for me, a never read Chinese. When I took classes, I found it hard to follow because I hardly understand what the passage is talking about, especially these historical passages. I spent lots of time practicing but with low payback, I still suck at reading. I was frustrated. Once my friend told me the best way to improve was to read more english books, no matter the kind, the time, and the author.</p>
<p>Comparing to do meaningless practices, I decided to read. The first book I read in my own will is <strong>1984</strong>.<br><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/bece72f/2147483647/crop/1276x837%2B0%2B211/resize/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fa8%2F4d%2F9a2507af4211a87d21850b9cbe1c%2F170127-1984-editorial.jpg" alt=""><br>I spennt nearly two months to finish this, and I can only get the main idea of each chapter without remembering more details in major conflicts. Since the book was similar to <strong>Brave New World</strong> I read in class, I have less trouble in understanding the world view in <strong>1948</strong> and the main idea. The book talks about a world wihch is controlled by three powers and they all have the same way of ruling people. <strong>“who controls the past controls the future”</strong> is the slogans in the main hero’s country. The governing party controls people in every aspect, words, language, sex, past, freedom and they have a telescreen everywhere to observe people’s move to connfirm whether they are making <strong>Thoughtcrime</strong>. </p>
<p>I think this Utopian world is one of the finest and most refined one I have seen(I have only seen three, hunger game, brave new world and 1948). Totalitarianism is depicted very vivid, the extreme conntrol over the citizens secure the absolute loyalty. Even someone who feels something is wrong about this word, the government has a place to brainwash this idea and replace it with wonderful things about this world. What impressed me most is a sentence uttered by Winston,”Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four”. This sentence expressed the power party exert on the information, as well the opposing emotion Winston potentially has. </p>
<p>I don’t want to say too much about the plot. It’s a story which you can feel the helplessness and understand it, and I think it gives a picture of what future maybe like. </p>
<h2 id="Other-books"><a href="#Other-books" class="headerlink" title="Other books"></a>Other books</h2><p>After reading 1984, I found out that I read faster than before and understand more quickly. So I started to read other books, I once watched the series of <strong>And Then There Is None</strong>, I was fasnicated by the plot designed and the character shaping. It’s written by Agatha Christie, a famous writer well known for its detective stories. I like her style of writing, it creates a bigger picture and shows each character’s deep aspect in the process.</p>
<h3 id="The-Murder-of-Roger-Ackroyd"><a href="#The-Murder-of-Roger-Ackroyd" class="headerlink" title="The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"></a>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</h3><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DcQZO7VML.jpg" alt="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DcQZO7VML.jpg"> </p>
<h3 id="The-ABC-Murder"><a href="#The-ABC-Murder" class="headerlink" title="The ABC Murder"></a>The ABC Murder</h3><p><img src="https://agathachristie.imgix.net/hcuk-paperback/The-ABC-Murders.JPG?auto=compress,format&amp;fit=clip&amp;q=65&amp;w=400" alt="https://agathachristie.imgix.net/hcuk-paperback/The-ABC-Murders.JPG?auto=compress,format&amp;fit=clip&amp;q=65&amp;w=400"></p>
<h3 id="The-Mysterious-Affair-at-Styles"><a href="#The-Mysterious-Affair-at-Styles" class="headerlink" title="The Mysterious Affair at Styles"></a>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</h3><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/918TvCMQO4L.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/918TvCMQO4L.jpg"></p>
<p>The essence of dective story is to deceive the reader, and Agatha did a great job in that. Everyone involved in the conflict is realted to the murder, the murder was a combination of series of mistakes and malice, and you can only see the truth when Hercule Poirot reveal the whole picture in front of you.</p>
<p>I hope you shares some of the feelings I have for reading. Reading is not as boring as I thought, and it gives a more vivid description of the story than depicted in the tv series or videos. When I read these lines, I can also experience the beauty possessed in English, the language is wonderful.</p>

<h2 id="Multi-Armed-Bandit"><a href="#Multi-Armed-Bandit" class="headerlink" title="Multi-Armed Bandit"></a>Multi-Armed Bandit</h2><p>let’s say that you are a gambler, and you are facing a Bandit with 5 arms, for each arm there’s a different probability of winning money. Maybe the first arm has 50% and the second arm has 53%. As a gambler, you want to find out which one possess the highest probability of winning money so that you can be <strong>Rich</strong>. But the same time, you don’t want to spent too many money in searching.</p>

<p>This question can be extended to many situations, for example a company wants to decide which one is the best advertisment for their product among five different advertising plan. In this case, the company wants to choose the plan with the most user click, because that shows the plan is attractive enough. what’s more, they don’t want to spent a lot resources to determine it. </p>
<p>Any queston related to choosing something can be simplyfied to Multi_Armed Bandit. </p>
<h1 id="UCB-–-Upper-Confidence-Bound"><a href="#UCB-–-Upper-Confidence-Bound" class="headerlink" title="UCB – Upper Confidence Bound"></a>UCB – Upper Confidence Bound</h1><p>UCB is one of the Bandit algorithm, dealing with choices. The mechnics behind this algorithm is confidence interval which is introduced in AP stats.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-confidence-interval-skip-if-you-have-already-know-this"><a href="#what-is-confidence-interval-skip-if-you-have-already-know-this" class="headerlink" title="what is confidence interval ?(skip if you have already know this)"></a>what is confidence interval ?(skip if you have already know this)</h2><p>If you have never enrolled in a AP stats class, don’t worry, after reading this sectionn you will have what you need to understand UCB. In statistics, a confidence interval is a type of estimate computed from the statistics of the observed data. In other words, it’s a interval that contains the true parameter. </p>
<p>For example, a 95% confidence innterval for the mean of all hig schools height is (140cm – 220cm). First, we have no way of obtaining every high schooler’s height in US, so we take a sample that is representative of the whole population and estimate the true mean from this sample. Second, 95% means that the probability of the true mean lies between 140 - 220 is 95%, in other words, if you take 100 representive sample, 95 of them will contain the true mean.</p>
<h2 id="UCB-and-Multi-Armed-Bandit"><a href="#UCB-and-Multi-Armed-Bandit" class="headerlink" title="UCB and Multi-Armed-Bandit"></a>UCB and Multi-Armed-Bandit</h2><p>Back to the 5 arms bandit, for each arm there’s a differennt probability of winning money. Let’s say that we have already do 1000 trials for each arm and concluded a distribution for it. (below)<br><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/04Ggq.jpg" alt=""><br> From the graph, it’s obvious that the <strong>fifth</strong> arm is the best one, because it has the highest mean, which means the highest probability of winning money. But for a gambler, you don’t have money to do 1000 trials with each arm. </p>
<h3 id="Mechanics"><a href="#Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Mechanics"></a>Mechanics</h3><p>The UCB first draw a same board confidence interval for all the arms which has very high certainty contain the true mean and updating the interval based each rounds of data fed in. Then the algorithm will choose the one with the highest upper bound. The algorithm will constantly choosing the one with the highest upper bound after the end each round. With more and more data feed in, the ad that has been chosen the highest times is the one we are looking for.</p>
<p>The graph below gives the formula of defining confidence interval. The cennter of the confidence interval is always the mean of the data currently have.<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmhq7tax8j31ia0u04qp.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmhq7tax8j31ia0u04qp.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>Important here, the initial confidence interval for each arm is the same.<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmbdw71oyj31nm0u0wx5.jpg" alt=""><br>In this graph, the red line represent the estimate mean for each arm, and the grey box is the upper bound and the lower bound. They construct a connfidence interval, and the different color line represent the true mean of each arm.</p>
<p>Second, since the upper bound for each interval is the same, doesn’t matter which one we start. if we start with D3, and the data shows that in the first round D3 was not clicked, then the confidence interval for D3 will be moved down and shorten.(becasue the winning probability’s range is shorten based on current data)<br><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmbs2jin3j31na0u0h5h.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmbs2jin3j31na0u0h5h.jpg"></p>
<p>The UCB algorithm will take in data for rounds, for example the first round, D1 and D5 are chosen and the others are not, then the confidence interval for each one is going to be different. And after the end of the round, UCB will record the ad with highest upper bound, and start the next round.</p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h2><p>maybe it’s hard to understand UCB in words, or maybe I am just bad at explaininng things. So I will put it into code which I hope can make more sense to you!</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">//get the data</span><br><span class="line">df = pd.read_csv(<span class="string">'Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv'</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmhd8hiqqj30lw0xg453.jpg" alt="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmhd8hiqqj30lw0xg453.jpg"><br>This example is a company wants to decide which ads is the most attractive one among the ten. 0 in dataset represent the user did not click, 1 is the opposite.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">## how many rounds </span></span><br><span class="line">N = <span class="number">10000</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># how many kinds of ads</span></span><br><span class="line">d = <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#a list used to record the selection of ads</span></span><br><span class="line">ads_selected = []</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#a list recording how many times the ad is chosen for each kind</span></span><br><span class="line">number_of_selection = [<span class="number">0</span>]*d</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#recrod the rewards received for each ad, in this case, its either 1 or 0</span></span><br><span class="line">sums_of_rewards = [<span class="number">0</span>]*d</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">total_reward = <span class="number">0</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In short, N is how many times we wants to try to know which one possess the greatest probability. And, ads_selected is the list or results, in UCB, the ads that has been chosen the most times is the most attractive one, so the most common number in ads_selected is the best ad.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> n <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>,N):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">##initialize</span></span><br><span class="line">    ad = <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">    max_upper_bound = <span class="number">0</span> </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">##start looping to find out which one's confidence intervak --- average_reward + delta i</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>,d):</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (number_of_selection[i] &gt; <span class="number">0</span>):</span><br><span class="line">            average_reward = sums_of_rewards[i] / number_of_selection[i]</span><br><span class="line">            delta_i = math.sqrt(<span class="number">3</span>/<span class="number">2</span> * math.log(n+<span class="number">1</span>) / number_of_selection[i])</span><br><span class="line">            upper_bound = average_reward + delta_i</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">            upper_bound = <span class="number">1e400</span></span><br><span class="line">       <span class="comment">## the way to find the highest Upper bound in each round      </span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (upper_bound &gt; max_upper_bound):</span><br><span class="line">            max_upper_bound = upper_bound</span><br><span class="line">            ad = i</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## updating the selections  </span></span><br><span class="line">    ads_selected.append(ad)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## update the number of selections of the chosen ad</span></span><br><span class="line">    number_of_selection[ad] = number_of_selection[ad] + <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## read from the dataset if the ad has been clicked</span></span><br><span class="line">    reward = df.values[n,ad]</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## updating the rewards for the chosen ad</span></span><br><span class="line">    sums_of_rewards[ad] = sums_of_rewards[ad] + reward</span><br><span class="line">    total_reward += reward</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Here, we first need to find out the approximated mean, which is the total rewards of this ad / how many times this ad are selected. And then, it follows the formula I gave above. </p>
<p>Important part to point out in code.</p>
<ol>
<li>the average_reward is constantly changing based on the change in Sums_of_reward and the number of selections.</li>
<li>when the algorithm start, each ad has the same confidence level and the number of selections for each ad is 0, which means impossible to get the average reward. I set the upper bound to be very large when the number of selections is 0(it will not affect the confidence interval because in each round the confidence interval is recalculated)  and the algorithm will loop through the first round to have a more precise interval and it will record the one with highest upper bound.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s visualize the power of UCB</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">plt.hist(ads_selected)</span><br><span class="line">plt.title(<span class="string">'Histogram of ads selections'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.xlabel(<span class="string">'Ads'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.ylabel(<span class="string">'Number of times each ad was selected'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.show()</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggmip2q5hij30n20fcq4a.jpg" alt=""><br>it’s obvious that ads 4 is the one we are looking for.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my notes on Reinforcement learning, I am just starting, so please forgive me if there’s anything confusing or worng. </p>

    <title>我的hexo博客</title>
    <url>/2020/07/05/%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84hexo%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h1 id="我的hexo博客"><a href="#我的hexo博客" class="headerlink" title="我的hexo博客"></a>我的hexo博客</h1><p> 前言</p>
<p> 为什么选择hexo?</p>
<p>我是一个在美高读书的学生党，自己在网上学过一些flask和react的知识，我本来想自己用react来搭建一个自给自足的博客，但是掌握的知识还是不够。然后我就想用个博客的框架来搭，选择很多，有wordpress，hugo，JekyII等等。具体可以等每个网站都看了再决定，我选择hexo因为他简洁，方便而且有我喜欢的主题。hexo有很多很有意思的插件可以让博客变得瞬间高大上，主要是安装特别方便，下载然后改一两行代码就行了。</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>wordpress 官网 <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.wordpress.org</a><br>hexo 官网 <a href="http://www.hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.hexo.io</a><br>JekyII官网 <a href="http://www.jekyll.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.jekyll.com</a><br>hugo 官网 <a href="http://www.gohugo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.gohugo.org</a><br>vuepress 官网 vuepress.vuejs.org</p>
<h2 id="搭建环境"><a href="#搭建环境" class="headerlink" title="搭建环境"></a>搭建环境</h2><p> Hexo是高效的静态站点生成框架，它基于Node.js。通过Hexo，你可以直接使用Markdown语法来撰写博客。相信很多小伙伴写工程都写过README.md文件吧，对，就是这个格式的！写完后只需两三条命令即可将生成的网页上传到你的github上，然后别人就可以看到你的网页啦。</p>
<h3 id="安装-Node-js"><a href="#安装-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="安装 Node.js"></a>安装 Node.js</h3><p><img src="https://railsware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2400%D1%851260-rw-blog-node-js.png" alt="node"></p>
<p>下载链接 <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nodejs.org/en/</a> （在官网上看到会有两个版本的node.js，没有什么大的区别）</p>
<p>下载好了之后一路点击<strong>Next</strong>直到显示安装成功。<br>然后打开终端（cmd）输入 <code>node -v</code> 和 <code>npm -v</code>，如果显示了版本号码的话就是成功了。</p>
<h3 id="安装-Git"><a href="#安装-Git" class="headerlink" title="安装 Git"></a>安装 Git</h3><p>很难解释Git到底是什么东西。简单来说就是一个能把自己的文件传输到Github，把别人分享的文件从Github下载下来的工具。</p>
<p>我知道的有两种下载方式</p>
<ul>
<li>1 网页下载 – <a href="https://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">下载地址</a></li>
<li>2 使用 pip下载<br>在cmd里输入<code>pip install git</code><br>完成后输入 <code>git -v</code>检查是否安装成功</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="安装-Hexo"><a href="#安装-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="安装 Hexo"></a>安装 Hexo</h3><ol>
<li>首先找到一个合适的目录，新建一个文件夹，名字自己取。如果比较懒可以像我一样直接放在桌面上。<code>/Users/jerry/Desktop/vegetable_blog</code></li>
<li>打开cmd，cd 到自己创建的blog文件夹，然后输入<code>npm install -g hexo-cli</code>，安装完以后就可以使用hexo关键词的命令比如 <code>hexo init</code></li>
<li>完成后输入<code>hexo -v</code>检查是否安装成功<br>tips：     这里安装可能会出现错误，名为 <code>EACCES: permission denied</code><br>一般来说有两种解决的方法</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>重新安装<strong>Node.js</strong>（我不推荐这样，因为我自己重装了好几遍还是没用）</li>
<li>更换安装全局Node的目录，具体的过程在<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个链接</a>（可能有点难懂里面的原理，但是不用担心，我也不懂，copy and paste就行了）</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>安装成功后，就可以开始初步搭建自己的博客了！初始化博客，输入<code>hexo init</code>初始化文件夹，接着输入<code>npm install</code>安装必备的组件。输入<code>hexo g</code>生成静态网页，然后输入<code>hexo s</code>打开本地服务器，然后浏览器打开<a href="http://localhost:4000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4000/</a>，就可以看到自己的博客啦。<br><img src="https://qiniu.cuiqingcai.com/2019-09-20-064939.png" alt="效果图"><br>输入 <code>ctrl c</code>关闭本地服务器</p>
</li>
<li><p>到了这一步，其实博客的所有基础都已经打好了，剩下的就是美化和部署了。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="部署到Github上"><a href="#部署到Github上" class="headerlink" title="部署到Github上"></a>部署到Github上</h3><p> 首先你需要一个Github的账号，我就不特地说明怎么注册了。<br> 进入到自己的Github页面，点击右上角 new repository<br> <img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/create-new-repo.png" alt="new"><br> 这里千万记得repository的名字是你的 github账号名字 + github.io，如果不一样的话，网页会出现404。</p>
<p>然后你能看到自己的SSH key<br><img src="https://pow123.github.io/Getting-Started-Git/fig/setup-repo-github.png" alt=""><br>这样一来先前的准备都做好了。</p>
<p>打开自己blog的文件夹找到一个名为<code>_config.yml</code>的文件，然后搜索关键词 <strong>deployment</strong>，在deployment下面输入两行代码（记得冒号后面要空格）：<br><code>type：git</code><br><code>repo: ssh key（之前提到的）</code></p>
<p>保存之后，在cmd输入<code>hexo d</code>，然后会要求你输入你的github账号和密码，显示成功后，在浏览器里输入repository的名字 （github账号 + github.io） 如果显示的是404，可以等一会儿再试，部署需要点时间，如果过了两三个小时还不行，那就说明之前的一步做错了。顺你好运！</p>
